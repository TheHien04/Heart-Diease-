![Background](Image/Background.jpg)

## 1. Introduction
Heart disease remains the **leading cause of death worldwide**, responsible for nearly one-third of all global fatalities.  
Understanding **patterns, risk factors, and prevention strategies** can significantly improve patient outcomes and inform healthcare policy.

This project develops an **interactive D3.js dashboard** analyzing 8 domains related to heart disease, using data visualization to uncover patterns and correlations.

## 5. Domain-by-Domain Analysis

### **Domain 1 ‚Äì Age vs Heart Disease**
- **Goal:** Identify correlation between age groups and heart disease prevalence.
- **Key Insight:** Prevalence increases significantly after age 50, reflecting biological aging and accumulated lifestyle/clinical risk.
- **Dashboard:**  
![Domain 1](Image/Domain%201.png)  

---

### **Domain 2 ‚Äì Gender vs Heart Disease**
- **Goal:** Compare disease rates between male and female.
- **Key Insight:** Males show slightly higher prevalence. This aligns with medical literature, where men often develop heart disease at earlier ages due to hormonal and lifestyle differences.
- **Dashboard:**  
![Domain 2](Image/Domain%202.png)  

---

### **Domain 3 ‚Äì Blood Pressure vs Heart Disease**
- **Goal:** Assess how blood pressure impacts disease likelihood.
- **Key Insight:** Hypertension (high BP) is strongly associated with higher heart disease incidence. Elevated BP damages arterial walls over time, increasing cardiac stress.
- **Dashboard:**  
![Domain 3](Image/Domain%203.png)  

---

### **Domain 4 ‚Äì Exercise Habits**
- **Goal:** Analyze the protective effect of regular exercise.
- **Key Insight:** Higher exercise frequency correlates with lower prevalence. Exercise improves circulation, lowers BP, and reduces cholesterol, mitigating disease risk.
- **Dashboard:**  
![Domain 4](Image/Domain%204.png)  

---

### **Domain 5 ‚Äì Average Cholesterol Level**
- **Goal:** Compare cholesterol levels between healthy and diseased groups.
- **Key Insight:** Patients with heart disease exhibit **higher average cholesterol**, confirming hyperlipidemia as a critical risk factor.
- **Dashboard:**  
![Domain 5](Image/Domain%205.png)  

---

### **Domain 6 ‚Äì Smoking**
- **Goal:** Evaluate smoking as a risk factor.
- **Key Insight:** Smokers have a **notably higher risk**. Smoking accelerates atherosclerosis, lowers oxygen supply, and damages vessel lining.
- **Dashboard:**  
![Domain 6](Image/Domain%206.png)  

---

### **Domain 7 ‚Äì Alcohol Consumption**
- **Goal:** Assess the relationship between alcohol intake and disease.
- **Key Insight:** Excessive alcohol correlates with increased prevalence. While moderate intake may be neutral, chronic consumption elevates BP and cholesterol.
- **Dashboard:**  
![Domain 7](Image/Domain%207.png)  

---

### **Domain 8 ‚Äì Cholesterol Distribution by Gender**
- **Goal:** Identify gender-based differences in cholesterol distribution.
- **Key Insight:** Males show slightly higher cholesterol variation. This aligns with risk profiles where men are more prone to early onset cardiovascular issues.
- **Dashboard:**

## 7. Conclusion & Recommendations
- **Lifestyle factors** (smoking, alcohol, inactivity) substantially elevate heart disease risk ‚Üí target public health campaigns here.  
- **Clinical markers** (blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI) remain critical for **early detection & monitoring**.  
- **Demographic patterns** (age, gender) highlight vulnerable groups for screening and intervention.  
- Data-driven dashboards like this can help **health policymakers and practitioners** allocate resources effectively, focusing on **preventive measures** and **high-risk cohorts**.

## 11. Future Work
This project currently focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **interactive visualization**.  
Potential extensions include:

- **Machine Learning Models**  
  - Apply classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to **predict heart disease** based on patient attributes.  
  - Evaluate models using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC**.  

- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Create new features such as **Age Groups**, **BMI Categories**, or combined lifestyle risk scores (e.g., *Smoking + Alcohol*).  
  - Assess how engineered features improve prediction power.  

- **Statistical Analysis**  
  - Perform hypothesis testing (Chi-square, ANOVA) to confirm significant relationships between categorical and continuous attributes.  

- **Deployment**  
  - Extend dashboard with **Flask/Django API** to serve predictive results.  
  - Deploy as a **web application** where users can input personal health data and get **real-time risk predictions**.  

- **Integration with External Data**  
  - Combine with **global health datasets** (e.g., WHO, CDC) to enrich insights.  
  - Enable **comparisons across countries/regions** for broader public health strategies.  

By expanding into **predictive modeling and deployment**, this project could move from descriptive analytics ‚Üí to **prescriptive insights**, supporting doctors and policymakers in making proactive, data-driven decisions.
