## 1. Introduction
Heart disease remains the **leading cause of death worldwide**, responsible for nearly one-third of all global fatalities. Understanding **patterns, risk factors, and prevention strategies** can significantly improve patient outcomes and inform healthcare policy.

This project develops an **interactive D3.js dashboard** analyzing 8 domains related to heart disease, using data visualization to uncover patterns and correlations.
